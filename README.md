# redux-store-ec

The objective of the project was to is to refactor the e-commerce platform so that it uses Redux. 
As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform, I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
